Because today the class was cancelled
How do I know?
Don't you have anything better to do?
The tall and the excessively bald engineer told me to do so
The ferret told us
It looked simple, that's why
To fool the tall good and smart system manager
The rich rich and tall and good system manager suggested it
He wanted it that way
The programmer suggested it
Barney suggested it
To please a very terrified and smart and tall engineer
The tall system manager obeyed some engineer
To satisfy some programmer
Damian wanted it that way
Can you rephrase that?
Because Damian wanted it that way
How should I know?
