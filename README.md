	(i) Trigonometric functions
	(ii) Fill screen size (Done)
	(iii) An enjoyable UI
	(iv) sqrt function (Done). In general, computing the (n^th) root
	(v) The WHY? button (this button gives a full range of random answers every time someone clicks it. Can be handy if you run out of answers in some situation :)). Inspired by MATLAB why command. (Done)
