# AndroidApps
A collection of android apps

HelloWorld: This is a simple Android app which is a simple calculator. Currently it is named Hello World, but in the future it will be renamed as Calculator.

(21st May, 2016): This is a fully functional calculator which can be used for additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions. Future Work: Intends to support trigonometric calculations as well. Currently, the app doesn't fill the screen exactly. This will be altered later.
